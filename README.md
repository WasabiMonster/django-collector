Django Collector -- Collects email addresses.
===

Django Collector is a django application that is used to collect email
addresses. The typical use case is a start-up that is in the
pre-launch phase and wants to collect email addresses so that a launch
notice may be sent out.

Django Collector is unique in that is provides a mechanism for people
to delete their email addresses before the launch notice is sent out.

Full data portability at all times!

## BUILD

This runs `python setup.py develop` (more or less).

    ./build.sh

## TEST

This uses `nosetests` to run the unit tests, and enables the built-in
coverage report.

    ./tests.sh
    sensible-browser ./src/python/collector/cover/index.html

## INSTALL

 * Use the [Software 6 PPA](https://launchpad.net/~software6/+archive/ppa):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:software6/ppa
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-django-collector

 * Create a .deb:

    debuild -uc -us -i -I
    sudo dpkg -i ../python-django-collector*.deb

 * Use the [Cheese Shop](http://pypi.python.org/pypi):

    pip install --user djang-collector

 * Link the source code under `${HOME}/.local`:

    pip install --user -e .

Please note that using `pip install --user` also requires something
like:

    PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/.local/lib/python27:${PYTHONPATH}
    export PYTHONPATH

## SETTINGS

 * `COLLECTOR_SEND_EMAIL`

   True or False. Default is False. Requires a working MTA. When True,
   Django Collector will send an email with instructions on how to
   delete the email address. This is as simple as clicking on a link
   in the email.

 * `COLLECTOR_FROM_EMAIL`

   Default is the empty string. This email address will be used in the
   From: field. For example `webmaster@example.com`.

 Each template may be localized. `%s` will be replaced by the user's
 preferred language, e.g. `es`.

 For example, in settings.py:

    LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

    _ = lambda x: x

    LANGUAGES = (
        ('en', _(u'English')),
        ('es', _(u'Espanol')),
    )

 means that English and Espa√±ol are supported. English is the
 default. Users that request other languages will get English.

 * `COLLECTOR_SUBJECT_TEMPLATE`

   Default is `collector-subject.tmpl.%s`.

 * `COLLECTOR_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`

   Default is `collector-message.tmpl.%s`.

 * `COLLECTOR_DELETED_TEMPLATE`

   Default is `collector-deleted.tmpl.%s`. This template will be
   displayed when the user deletes her email address by clicking the
   link in the email sent to her.

 * `COLLECTOR_BLOB404_TEMPLATE`

   Default is `collector-blob404.tmpl.%s`. This template will be
   displayed when the user attempts to delete an email address that
   has already been deleted.

## TEMPLATE VARIABLES

 * `COLLECTOR_URL`

   This is a fully-qualified, hard-to-guess, and unique URL that will
   delete the associated email address when clicked. This is expected
   to appear in the `COLLECTOR_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`.
